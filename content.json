{"pages":[],"posts":[{"title":"About me","text":"Hi, my name is Cheng Gong. I am looking forward to transit my role from development project manager to software engineer. I developed strong interest in the field of software development and computer science when I was working at a mobile game development studio as a project manager since 2015. With the goal in my mind, I have been learning relavant knowledges by myself and I will continue to learn and practice more. I will be sharing my learnings in this blog site. :) A little bit more about my previous experience:At the time I joined the game studio, I was in charge of all the localization projects and helped the studio to establish a productive inter-departmental communication protocol. In 2016, I became a game development project manager as the company shifted strategy from game publishing to game development. In my new role, I have adopted Agile development methodology for the development team, and utilized issue tracking and collaboration tools such as JIRA and Confluence. My responsibilities included managing two Agile development teams at the same time, facilitating and continually improving development process, making data-driven decisions, defining content roadmaps, and ensuring cross-functional communication smoothly. Under my management, the team shipped a globally successful game, a MMORPG, in 2017 on several platforms including App Store, Google Play, Stream, and Facebook Gameroom. In order to enhance my professional skills, I took various online courses in my spare time such as engineering project management, Python programming, and game design. The self-paced online learning experience enables me to manage time wisely, and also proved my self-learning skill.","link":"/2019/03/18/About-me/"},{"title":"My first post","text":"Welcome to my blog! :)","link":"/2019/03/18/My-first-post/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
